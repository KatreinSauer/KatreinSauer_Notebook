This post is about Synchrotron based XRD, XRF, Raman data on Stylophora Pistillata

## X-ray diffraction and fluorescence data on adult stony coral samples

### Figures ###
1. Photography of corals Stillophora Pistillata \
2. SEM image

## Absorption Images ###
3. Transmission images from Spec-files (BESSY, found wihtin one of the last columns)
4. Transmission (T) transformed into Absorption (A):\
  A = 1-T \
  --> T was determined with Fiji, looking for the highest intensity value within histogram and this is defined then as "100% transmission = 1 in formula":\
a)  100% = 593751.44 \
As -A = T - 1 and T = our image:\
with Fiji:\
&#8594; click on transmission image
&#8594; process
&#8594; math
&#8594; substract 593751.44
&#8594; afterwards multiply with (-1)


### XRD ###

### RAMAN paper figure ###
 ## Compare with ORIGIN:  peak width of peak with the highest intensity (number 1086). The peak width broadens the more the crystals (aragonite/calcite) lose the cristalinity and apear amorphous. I want to see if ACC is preesnt ##
